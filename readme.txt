== Description ==
This is a simple plugin that provides an A-Z index of the posts displayed on a particular page based on the post title.
To use this plugin just put the shortcode [azindex] on the page you want to display an A-Z index on.

This is very beta at the moment, it has only been tested on query_posts() so don't go mad if it doesn't work for you. Let me know though.

There are css styles that you can override in your own template.
