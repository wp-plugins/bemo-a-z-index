== Description ==
This is a simple plugin that provides an A-Z index of the posts displayed on a particular page based on the post title.
To use this plugin just put the shortcode [azindex] on the page you want to display an A-Z index on.

This is very beta at the moment, it has only been tested on query_posts() so don't go mad if it doesn't work for you. Let me know though.

We are also working on a pro version, please let us know what you would like to see in that version.

There are css styles that you can override in your own template.

I'm available for paid support only should you need any.
